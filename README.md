## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used this project to learn the basics of React and Chakra UI.
This was a great experiance because it was challenging to a point where i need to figure out how to use styles with chakra ui and deal with the constraints of React.
while it's not pure HTML and CSS it is simplify the process by emphasizing using components.
although it was an introduction level of add functionality only on email validation, i got a lot of insight as to how React is implementing said methods, which i find a bit tricky at first but the more i practice with it the more fluide it will become.
In conclusion this project was a great way to get a little bit more comfortable with React, which was my main focus.

### Continued development

The following projects will be more challenging because i'll focuse on creating more complex functions and styled components, my goal is to be knowledgeable enough with React to build web application, APIs and more elegent web sites.
